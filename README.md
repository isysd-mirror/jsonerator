jsonerator
==========


Overview
--------

Minimal web interface to create a personal JSON for [Smart Spaces](http://smartspac.es) (and the greater Internet of Things).  Simply enter any or all of the fields at left and the JSON will automatically be populated.  Try it live via GitHub pages: [reelyactive.github.io/jsonerator/](http://reelyactive.github.io/jsonerator/)

Yes, by _minimal_ we mean __minimal__.  We've intentionally kept it this way so that you can easily understand the code and quickly style the page as you wish with CSS.  In most cases, we expect this code to be embedded in an existing page.


Installation
------------

Simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your favourite web browser.


Notes
-----

There is absolutely no validation of fields at this time.  Whatever the user enters in the form comes out in the JSON.
